2418. SORT the People   
/////
/////
/////
/////

you are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.
For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

 

Example 1:

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

class Solution {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        HashMap<Integer,String> hm=new HashMap<>();
        int k=0;
        for(int i=0;i<heights.length;i++){
            hm.put(heights[i],names[k++]);
        }
        Arrays.sort(heights);
        String[] res=new String[names.length];
        k=0;
        for(int i=heights.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            res[k++]=hm.get(heights[i]);
        }
return res;
    }
}
